### <p align="center">👻 Specter 👻</p>

<br><br>
<p align="center">
<strong>
First of all, if you're looking for the <strong>BEST</strong> fully Python obfuscator, you should check out <a href="https://github.com/therealOri/Hyperion">Hyperion</a>!
<br><br>
Specter is another Python3 obfuscator using a special technique to make your code <i>even harder</i> to deobfuscate.
<br>
It is going to add multiple layers, with a final layer allowing the user to camouflate his code so the obfuscate code looks like a normal one.

### <p align="center">⭐ Features ⭐</p>

<br><br>

<strong>+ This time you can be sure skids won't be able to get your code</strong>
<br>
<strong>+ Very fast execution</strong>
<br>
<strong>+ Very good obfuscation</strong>
<br>
<strong>+ Can be compiled to .EXE</strong>

<br>
<br>

> Extra notes

<strong>- You have around 1/10 chance for your obfuscated code to cause an error (I don't know why). If it does, please obfuscate it again.</strong>
<br>
<strong>- Specter isn't compatible with all Python versions. You will have to try it yourself to see if it'll work.</strong>
